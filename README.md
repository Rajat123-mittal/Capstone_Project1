## **About the Project**

Welcome to the Introduction to Computer Programming project, designed to assess your practical application and comprehension of fundamental programming concepts using Python. This evaluation encompasses a wide range of topics, including data types, indexing, slicing, operators, built-in functions, statements, conditionals, loops, object-oriented programming, and exception handling. Additionally, you'll have the opportunity to showcase your ability to create custom functions and tackle advanced looping concepts.

## **Problem Statement**

The CodeStorm Challenge is an intense coding competition designed to test participants' programming skills, problem-solving abilities, and communication prowess. In this challenge, participants will be required to solve a total of 30 intricate coding questions that cover a wide range of algorithms, data structures, and programming paradigms. Additionally, participants are tasked with creating an explanatory video that delves into the solutions of any five chosen questions.

The challenge aims to evaluate participants on their coding efficiency, algorithmic thinking, and presentation skills. Participants will need to not only implement correct and optimized solutions to the coding problems . 

## **Required Skills**

To successfully complete this project assessment, you should have the following skills and knowledge:

- Proficiency in the Python programming language
- Familiarity with data types, indexing, and slicing in Python
- Understanding of operators, built-in functions, and methods
- Ability to work with statements, indentation, and conditionals
- Competence in implementing various types of loops and iterations, including conditional and infinite looping
- Mastery of creating and utilizing custom functions in Python
- Knowledge of advanced looping concepts
- Understanding of the principles of object-oriented programming (OOPs) in Python
- Ability to handle exceptions in your code effectively

## **Approach to solving a problem**
First I read and understood the problem carefully. When I understood the problem completely, I started writing its code.

## **Conclusion**
After solving the above problem, you will learn how to solve Python problems and analyze data and after solving this project you will have improve to your problem solving statement in Python.
